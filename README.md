playground
==========

Simple Playground for One-Off Go Code. This is similar in spirit to Go Playground (http://play.golang.org/) but is 
meant to be used locally. I setup a bash alias ("p" on my machine) to cd into this directory. It's a quick place to
run sample code or try ideas, i.e. mostly what I was using Go Playground for previously.
